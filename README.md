# About me

Hey! I'm Sophie and I'm pursuing a career in Cloud Engineering. I have a degree in Politics and International Relations and have recently taken a year out to volunteer in South America and Africa. During my year out I discovered I needed a career to fuel my enthusiasm for problem solving and aptitude for learning and came across the Cloud Engineering pathway at Digital Futures. 

12 weeks down the line I can honestly say I have found a career path I am truly passionate about. Since finishing the academy, I have been developing my skills in Docker and Terraform. I am taking every opportunity to develop my skills and broaden my knowledge in Cloud.

Check out my projects to see what I've been up to!
